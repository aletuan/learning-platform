## 5. User Scenarios & User Flows

### Scenario 1: Desktop User Watching Full Course
**Context**: Professional developer accessing React Hooks tutorial from office computer

**User Flow**:
1. User clicks on video thumbnail from course page
2. Video player loads with loading indicator
3. Video begins playback automatically in appropriate quality (720p/1080p)
4. User can adjust volume, seek through content, change quality
5. Progress is automatically saved for resumption
6. User can navigate to next video in sequence

**Expected Behavior**:
- Video starts within 3 seconds
- No buffering during playback with stable internet
- Smooth quality transitions if network changes
- Progress saved every 10 seconds

### Scenario 2: Mobile User on Commute
**Context**: Student watching educational content during train commute with variable mobile data

**User Flow**:
1. User opens mobile browser/app and selects video
2. Player detects mobile device and mobile network
3. Video starts in lower quality (480p) to ensure smooth playback
4. Quality automatically adjusts based on network speed
5. User can switch to audio-only mode to save data
6. Video resumes from last position when reopened

**Expected Behavior**:
- Automatic quality adjustment within 5 seconds of network change
- Audio-only option available
- Minimal data usage in low-quality mode
- Seamless transition between network types

### Scenario 3: Poor Network Conditions
**Context**: Remote learner with limited broadband accessing video content

**User Flow**:
1. User attempts to watch video with slow internet connection
2. Player detects low bandwidth and adjusts to lowest quality (360p)
3. Video preloads enough content to prevent buffering
4. User can manually select lower quality if needed
5. Progress continues to be tracked despite interruptions

**Expected Behavior**:
- Immediate quality downgrade when bandwidth issues detected
- Buffer at least 30 seconds of content ahead
- Graceful degradation without playback failure
